# Welcome to an Azure Communication Services Calling Widget Sample

<img src='./media/Sample-app-splash.png' width='1000'>

This project is aimed to teach developers on how to create a Calling Widget using the Azure Communication UI Library.

Depending on your needs, you might need to create an experience for your customers to be able to get a hold of you with minimal setup on their part.
Calling Widget is a tool that is meant for allowing instant interaction, whether that is reaching out to customer support, having a quick call with your financial advisor, or other customer facing teams. The goal of this sample is to help make you one click away from your customers.

If you want to just try it out follow the instructions below. If you are interested in information on how to build it into your application and how this sample is constructed please checkout our [tutorial here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/tutorials/calling-widget/calling-widget-overview).

## Try It Out

To just run the completed code, In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

### Swap placeholders for identifiers
Go to the `src` folder and find the `App.tsx` file.
There input values for the `token`, `userId` and `locator`.

### Run the application

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
