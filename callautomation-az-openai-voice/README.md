# Call Automation - Quick Start Sample

This sample application shows how the Azure Communication Services - Call Automation SDK can be used with Azure OpenAI Service .

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You will need to record your resource **connection string** for this sample.
- Get a phone number for your new Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Get a phone number](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- An Azure OpenAI Resource and Deployed Model. See [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

## Before running the sample for the first time

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the sample to.
2. git clone `https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts.git`.
3. cd into the `callautomation-az-openai-voice` folder.
4. From the root of the above folder, and with node installed, run `npm install`

### Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8080
devtunnel host
```

### Configuring application

Open the `.env` file to configure the following settings

1. `CONNECTION_STRING`: Azure Communication Service resource's connection string.
2. `CALLBACK_URI`: Base url of the app. (For local development replace the dev tunnel url)
3. `AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_KEY`: Azure Open AI service key
4. `AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`: Azure Open AI endpoint
5. `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL_NAME`: Azure Open AI deployment name

### Run app locally

1. Open a new Powershell window, cd into the `callautomation-az-openai-voice` folder and run `npm run dev`
2. Browser should pop up with the below page. If not navigate it to `http://localhost:8080/`
3. Register an EventGrid Webhook for the IncomingCall Event that points to your 8080 port URI (ex. https://<ngrokurl>/api/incomingCall). Instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-automation/incoming-call-notification).

Once that's completed you should have a running application. The best way to test this is to place a call to your ACS phone number
