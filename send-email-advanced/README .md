# Email Sample

## Overview

This is a sample email application to show how we can use the `@azure/communication-email` package to build an email experience.
This sample sends an email to the selected recipients of any domain using an [Email Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/email/create-email-communication-resource).
This is a console application built using Node.js 14.

Additional documentation for this sample can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview).


## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code (Stable Build)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- [Node.js (~14)](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.19.1/).
- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You'll need to record your resource **connection string** for this Sample.
- Create an [Azure Email Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/email/create-email-communication-resource) to start sending emails.

> Note: We can send an email from our own verified domain also [Add custom verified domains to Email Communication Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/email/add-custom-verified-domains).
