# Add 1 on 1 video calling to your application

This code sample walks through the process of integration Azure Communication Services video calling into your JavaScript application.

This quickstart sample includes the code that is explained as part of [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-with-video-calling). See that document for additional details on how this sample works.

## Prerequisites
- Obtain an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1)
- Create an active Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- Create a User Access Token to instantiate the call client. [Learn how to create and manage user access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript).


## Run the code
1. Run `npm i` on the directory of the project to install dependencies
2. Add a [user access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens?pivots=programming-language-javascript) in line 55 of the `client.js`.
3. Use the webpack-dev-server to build and run your app. Run the following command to bundle application host in on a local webserver:

        npx webpack-dev-server --entry ./client.js --output bundle.js --debug --devtool inline-source-map

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/. You should see the following:

You can make an 1:1 outgoing video call by providing a user ID in the text field and clicking the Start Call button.
