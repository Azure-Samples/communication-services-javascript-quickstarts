ACS Client Calling SDK integration with Azure OpenAI

Reimagining customer support and Business insight
Azure Communication Services real-time voice and video Client Calling SDK can be used for a wide range of Business To Consumer calling scenarios. 
In all scenarios, your application will benefit from a wide ecosystem of Azure cloud services.
This project is an integration of Azure Communication Services Client Calling SDK with Azure Open AI to show how businesses could benefit from artificial intelligence in a client-calling flow. 
In this Contact Center as a Service model, the contact center support agent receives live recommendations from Open AI on what to say next to best support the customer. 
Also, call sentiment and call summary that are generated by Open AI can be used by businesses for visualizing call insight. 


Example scenario:
Imagine a Contoso Live support agent resolving customer issues. In a call, the live support agent must understand customer issues, and come up with troubleshooting suggestions and the agent must also gather customer details and fill in a form to create a support ticket.  
On the other hand, business wants to learn about call insight, such as call sentiment and call summary for business strategy and training purpose. This sample project shows how real-time intelligence can support a live agent and the business with insights:

1.	A Contoso customer calls the Contoso business support agent, who is a team’s identity joining the call through the Contoso application build with Azure Communication Services Client calling SDK.
2.	The Contoso support agent’s client application receives the closed captions of the conversation between the customer and the agent from Azure Communication Services Client Calling SDK.
3.	Azure Communication Services now has a new feature to enable Closed Captions for VoIP calls. Closed Captions are the conversion of a voice or video call audio track into written words that appear in real-time. Right now this feature is Generally Available for calls involving both ACS and Teams’ identity and available in Private Preview for calls involving only ACS identities for both web and native platforms.
4.	The closed captions are sent from the client application to a back-end service built with Azure functions, that is set up to act as a gateway to Azure Open AI. Two prompts are set, one to get Contoso agent suggestions along with customer data gathered from the conversation for form filling and the other one is to gather call sentiment and insights for Business monitoring purposes.
5.	The agent suggestions received from the back end are shown on the Contoso support agent client application user interface. These suggestions give hints to support the agent in solving the customer's issue. The customer information is gathered from the conversation by AI and is used to fill in support ticket creation forms to help the agent with support ticket creation. 
6.	Business insights such as call sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) and call insight summary are sent from the back-end service to Azure monitor, and logs analytics for business visualization
